# **Profitability Analysis of Betting Strategies Using OddsPortal Data**

## **Project Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing the profitability of betting strategies for two distinct markets:
- **1-2 market** for tennis, where only two outcomes are possible (Player 1 wins or Player 2 wins).
- **1-X-2 market** for soccer, which includes three possible outcomes (Home win, Draw, Away win).

The analysis pipeline begins with **data cleaning** and progresses through **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **visualization**, and ultimately to **profitability evaluation**. The primary goal is to identify patterns and evaluate the potential profitability of different betting strategies based on historical odds data.

All data parsing and collection steps have been completed and organized into repository files, ensuring the README focuses solely on the analysis process.
